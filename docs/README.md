The documentation for the Blender glTF 2.0 exporter is splitted up into two main sections.

[User Documentation](user.md)  
One for the Blender user, who wants to export a Blender scene to the glTF 2.0 format.
The purpose of the section is for understanding the usage of the exporter. 

[Developer Documentation](developer.md)  
The other for developers, who want to do bug fixes and/or extend the exporter.
This section is mainly for developers, who need to understand the source of the exporter.
